# NEXUS-RISK — Blockchain AML Detection Engine

> Built by a financial services professional who got tired of seeing compliance tools that didn't understand how crypto actually moves.

## What This Is

A working fraud detection engine for blockchain transactions. Not a concept. Not a demo. An actual system that was trained and tested against real Etherscan data from known exploits — Tornado Cash, Ronin Bridge, Lazarus Group, Wormhole, and the Nomad crowd-looting attack.

It evolved from a traditional AML rule engine (threshold + velocity) into a full 3-layer detection stack: rules → AI anomaly detection → dynamic triage labeling.

**Built from the inside out.** I work in financial services. I know what compliance teams actually need from a tool like this and what they're not getting from current systems.

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall detection rate | **94.9%** |
| False positive rate | **20.2%** |
| Total rules | **26** (v12: +phish, +sub-threshold tranching, +machine cadence, +sybil fan-in) |
| Transactions tested | **813** (644 real Etherscan + 169 synthetic forensic) |
| Analyst queue reduction (triage) | **63%** |
| AI-only anomalies found | **21** |

## Case Studies — Real Exploits, Real Data

| Case | Attack Type | Detection | Notes |
|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Tornado Cash (0.1/10/100 ETH + Gov) | Mixer laundering | **100%** | All 311 txns caught |
| Lazarus Group / Stake.com hack | State actor + OFAC | **100%** | All 119 txns caught |
| Ronin Bridge ($625M) | State actor + bridge | **84.3%** | Miss = non-OFAC intermediaries |
| Bybit drainer | Flash drain | **100%** | Single-tx event |
| Euler Finance ($197M) | Flash loan exploit | **23.3%** | Miss = needs block-level timestamps |
| Wormhole Bridge ($320M) | Bridge exploit | **100%** | Synthetic forensic data |
| Nomad Bridge ($190M) | Crowd looting (300+ wallets) | **100%** | Synthetic forensic data |
| Vitalik.eth (control) | Legitimate whale | **20.4% FP** | Known wallet, low false flag rate |
| ETH Foundation (control) | Legitimate institutional | **20.0% FP** | Grant distribution pattern |

The 5.1% detection gap is structural — Euler needs block-level timestamps (not available in hourly Etherscan data), Ronin's intermediaries aren't OFAC-listed. More rules won't close this gap. Better data sources will.

## The 26 Rules

**v6 · Core Thresholds**
`large_amount` · `velocity` · `fan_in` · `structuring`

**v7 · Chain-Native**
`mixer_touch` · `bridge_hop` · `peel_chain` · `layering`

**v8 · Wallet Intelligence**
`novel_dump` · `conc_inflow`

**v9 · Speed + Sanctions**
`OFAC_SDN` · `flash_loan_burst` · `coord_burst`

**v10 · Dormancy**
`dormant_activation` — BitFinex-style sleeping wallets reviving after years

**v11 · Advanced Patterns**
`wash_cycle` · `smurfing` · `exit_rush` · `rapid_succession` · `high_risk_country` · `exchange_avoidance` · `layering_deep`

**v12 · Live Feeds + Modern Typologies**
`phishing_hit` (MetaMask + no-KYC offramps) · `sub_threshold_tranching` (just-under-$10k bunches) · `machine_cadence` (bot-timing signatures) · `sybil_fan_in` (airdrop-sybil / drainer collectors)

**v13 · Drainer + Multi-Asset**
`drainer_signature` (Inferno / Angel drainer pattern — approval + multi-asset drain) · `address_poisoning` (0-value lookalike first-4/last-4 match)

### Live threat-intelligence feeds
The sanctions and phishing lists are now refreshable from the `engine/feeds.py` loader:
- **OFAC SDN** — 0xB10C community mirror (US Treasury virtual-currency addendum)
- **MetaMask eth-phishing-detect** — address-level drainer list
- **Chainalysis Sanctions Oracle** — on-chain belt-and-braces check via `CHAINALYSIS_RPC_URL`
- **Analyst-curated** — no-KYC off-ramps, LRT drainers, mixer/bridge rosters

Run `python scripts/refresh_feeds.py` (cron-ready) to pull the latest. `FEEDS_OFFLINE=1` keeps CI and air-gapped deployments happy — baselines ship in the repo.

## Attack Pattern Taxonomy

| Group | Attacks | Signature |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Mixer Laundering | Tornado Cash | Country flag + mixer touch + layering |
| State Actor | Ronin, Lazarus, Bybit | OFAC match + bridge + fan-out |
| Protocol Exploit | Euler | Flash loan burst + novel wallet + rapid dump |
| Dormant Revival | BitFinex | 5+ year dormancy + sudden large move |
| Bridge Exploit | Wormhole, Nomad | Novel wallet + bridge + coordinated burst |

## How to Run

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

**Run the rule engine on sample data:**
```bash
python engine/engine_v11_blockchain.py
# Output: risk scores, triage tiers, SAR narratives
```

**Run the AI layer:**
```bash
python ai_layer/aml_ai_layer.py
# Requires rule engine output first
```

**Run triage scoring:**
```bash
python ai_layer/triage_labeler.py
# Output: LEGENDARY/RARE/MAGIC/COMMON classification per transaction
```

**View the dashboard:**
```
Open dashboard/nexus_dashboard.html in any browser
No server needed — fully static
```

**On your own data:**
Point `DATA_PATH` in `engine_v11_blockchain.py` to your CSV. Required columns:
```
sender_id, receiver_id, amount, country, timestamp
```
Optional (improves detection): `sender_tx_count`, `sender_avg_amount`, `sender_active_days`, `account_type`

**Real Ethereum data** (requires Etherscan API key):
Edit `scripts/generate_cases.py` with your API key — fetches real transaction history for any wallet address.
